How to start use gdb:
    -> $ gdb <executive file>

Static program inspection:
    [info target]                       | Give common info about current executive
    [maint info sections]  <SECTIONS>   | Much more detailed info about sections, also shows their flags
    [info functions]                    | Give info about FUNC symbols in program
    [info variables]                    | Give info about OBJECT symbols in program
    [disassemble] <FUNC_SYMBOL>         | Returns disassemble of the selected function
        {
            Disassemble options:
                /s                          | Includes source
                /rs                         | Shows raw instructions with opcode
                /sr 'file'::func            | Returns disassemble of the selected function from selected file
        }

Runtime inspection of a program
    [r]                                 | To run program
    [b]                                 | To set a breakpoint on a selected code line
        {
            Breakpoint arguments:
                1)Lines                     [(gdb) b 3]
                2)Function                  [(gdb) b main]
                3)Memory address            [(gdb) b *0x400526]
                4)<Source file>:<code row>  [(gdb) b hello.c:3]
                5)<Source file>:<function>  [(gdb) b hello.c:main]
        }
    [n]                                 | To proceed to the next statement
    [s]                                 | To make step into
    [ni]                                | Do not make full step but go to the next instruction
    [si]                                | Step into the next instruction of called function
    [until]                             | This comands executes until the next line is greater than current
    [finish]                            | This comands executes until function return it's value (better way to go through functions)
    [bt]                                | Prints backtrace of all stack frames. Backtrace is a list of currently active functions
    [up/down]                           | Makes step UP/DOWN in the stack frame
    [info registers]                    | Shows the most common registers
